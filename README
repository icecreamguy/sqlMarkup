This PHP class lets you easily post-process a SQL statement to add some HTML markup for easy syntax highlighting. Its usage is fairly straightforward:

1.) Load and create an instance of the class
    include('<path-to-sqlMarkup.php>/sqlMarkup.php');
    $sqlMarkerUpper = new sqlMarkup();

2.) Set the statement property of your new class
    $sqlMarkerUpper->setStatement($someSQLString);

3.) Print the marked up string
    echo $sqlMarkerUpper->getMarkedStatement();

And that's it! It's pretty barebones and does NOT have all of the SQL reserved words. In addition, some of the reserved words are MySQL-specific. In the near future I hope to add the real ANSI list of SQL reserved words.
